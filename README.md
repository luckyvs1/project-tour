## How to use

Install it and run (for backend need a .env file with the Google API key labelled `GOOGLE_API_KEY`):

```sh
npm install
npm run start
```

## API Key setup

### Backend
- For backend calls need a Google API key setup in a .env file the labelled `GOOGLE_API_KEY`
- Currently requires additional config for Knex.js (to remove to simplify setup)

### Frontend
- Currently the API key is hardcoded (open issue to replace it using an environment parameter instead)
